2016.09.26 - Hi Elisabeth. I know you are new to the course, so I'm sorry if 
you came along at a difficult point in the semester. Keep in mind that the
problem sets are graded on a SUBMISSION basis. Submitting anything by the
deadline (even a blank .r file) counts as completion and you get the same
grade whether it is perfect or blank. Do submit everything in the future and
you will pass the class! That doesn't mean that you shouldn't try the homeworks 
though and if you have issues don't hesitate to reach out to me or your fellow
students, economists may be socially awkward, but we are actually very nice!
See you Friday!
